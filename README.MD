# Intro
This is the repository for a knowledge graph generation and evaluation project titled 'Evaluate Knowledge Graphs as Queryable Obejects'(may change in the future; with some links).  
The repository contains mainly a Jupyter Notebook for reproducing experiments' results and one 'data' directory, for now, it stores ~~CSV~~(note: don't use CSV, it's technically not automatic, needs manual definition of nodes and edges) .dump files exported from Neo4j database snapshot for future import and reproduction.
